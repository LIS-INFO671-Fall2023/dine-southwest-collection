## About the Collection

Our goals for this project were to demonstrate the living cultures of Indigenous people in the Arizona-Southwest region, to construct an enhanced collection that utilizes culturally specific descriptive terms, and to provide a wider depth of Indigenous cultural context. Because the bulk of the images in the collection are going to be representative of Diné (Navajo) communities, we aim to include descriptions in Diné language to demonstrate respect for the original language and the originating peoples. We are focused on primarily Diné (Navajo) speakers and Native communities, then researchers, and the public as user groups. Because of the history of colonialism and the treatment of Indigenous peoples globally, our collection seeks to represent Native peoples respectfully and accurately for the communities relevant to the collection items.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
